        1) If T is an object or reference type and the variable definition T obj(std::declval<Args>()...); is well-formed, provides the member constant value equal to true. In all other cases, value is false.
        For the purposes of this check, the variable definition is never interpreted as a function declaration, and the use of std::declval is not considered an odr-use.
        Access checks are performed as if from a context unrelated to T and any of the types in Args. Only the validity of the immediate context of the variable definition is considered.

        2) same as 1), but the variable definition does not call any operation that is not trivial. For the purposes of this check, the call to std::declval is considered trivial.

        3) same as 1), but the variable definition is noexcept.

        T and all types in the parameter pack Args shall each be a complete type, (possibly cv-qualified) void, or an array of unknown bound. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
        If an instantiation of a template above depends, directly or indirectly, on an incomplete type, and that instantiation could yield a different result if that type were hypothetically completed, the behavior is undefined.
        The behavior of a program that adds specializations for any of the templates described on this page is undefined.
