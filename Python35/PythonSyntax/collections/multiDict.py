def test_defaultdict():

    print(" --- default dict --- ")

    # Returns a new dictionary-like object. defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class.
    # It overrides one method and adds one writable instance variable. The remaining functionality is the same as for the dict class and is not documented here.
    # The first argument provides the initial value for the default_factory attribute; it defaults to None. All remaining arguments are treated the same as if they were passed to the dict constructor, including keyword arguments.

    # New in version 2.5.
    # defaultdict objects support the following method in addition to the standard dict operations:

    # __missing__(key)
    # If the default_factory attribute is None, this raises a KeyError exception with the key as argument.
    # If default_factory is not None, it is called without arguments to provide a default value for the given key, this value is inserted in the dictionary for the key, and returned.
    # If calling default_factory raises an exception this exception is propagated unchanged.

    # This method is called by the __getitem__() method of the dict class when the requested key is not found; whatever it returns or raises is then returned or raised by __getitem__().
    # Note that __missing__() is not called for any operations besides __getitem__(). This means that get() will, like normal dictionaries, return None as a default rather than using default_factory.

    # defaultdict objects support the following instance variable:

    # default_factory
    # This attribute is used by the __missing__() method; it is initialized from the first argument to the constructor, if present, or to None, if absent.

    # defaultdict
    # Using list as the default_factory, it is easy to group a sequence of key-value pairs into a dictionary of lists:
    s = [('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3), ('blue', 4), ('red', 1)]
    d = defaultdict(list)

    for i, k in s:
        d[i].append(k)
