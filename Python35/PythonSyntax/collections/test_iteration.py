# Interprator is going to check, __iter__, __next__, or __getitem__ in iterable objects

# *** Iterator Types
# Python supports a concept of iteration over containers. This is implemented using two distinct methods; these are used to allow user-defined classes to support iteration.
# Sequences, described below in more detail, always support the iteration methods.

# One method needs to be defined for container objects to provide iteration support:

# *** container.__iter__()
# Return an iterator object. The object is required to support the iterator protocol described below.
# If a container supports different types of iteration, additional methods can be provided to specifically request iterators for those iteration types.
# (An example of an object supporting multiple forms of iteration would be a tree structure which supports both breadth-first and depth-first traversal.)
# This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

# The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two methods, which together form the iterator protocol:

# *** iterator.__iter__()
# Return the iterator object itself. This is required to allow both containers and iterators to be used with the for and in statements.
# This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

# *** iterator.__next__()
# Return the next item from the container. If there are no further items, raise the StopIteration exception.
# This method corresponds to the tp_iternext slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

# Python defines several iterator objects to support iteration over general and specific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more specialized forms.
# The specific types are not important beyond their implementation of the iterator protocol.

# Once an iteratorâ€™s __next__() method raises StopIteration, it must continue to do so on subsequent calls.
# Implementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken.



# *** next(iterator[, default])
# Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its __next__() method.
# If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.

# *** iter(object[, sentinel])
# Return an iterator object. The first argument is interpreted very differently depending on the presence of the second argument.
# Without a second argument, object must be a collection object which supports the iteration protocol (the __iter__() method), or it must support the sequence protocol (the __getitem__() method with integer arguments starting at 0).
# If it does not support either of those protocols, TypeError is raised. If the second argument, sentinel, is given, then object must be a callable object.
# The iterator created in this case will call object with no arguments for each call to its __next__() method; if the value returned is equal to sentinel, StopIteration will be raised, otherwise the value will be returned.
