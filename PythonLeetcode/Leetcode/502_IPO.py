# 502. IPO

# Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital,
# LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources,
# it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO.
# Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.

# You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to
# start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project,
# you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

# To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital,
# and output your final maximized capital.

#Example 1:

# Input: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].

# Output: 4

# Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
#             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
#             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
#             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
#             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

        Approach 1: Greedy with Heap
            Intuition
            
            This is a greedy problem, and the only hard moment here is that capital is changing and so the list of available projects.
            
            fig
            
            That could be solved by using two data structures:
            
            projects to track all the projects which are not implemented yet.
            
            available to track projects available with the current capital.
            
            pic
            
            Algorithm
            
            To speed up, first check if here is a situation when all the projects are available with the initial capital W >= max(Capital). If so, return the sum of kth largest elements in Profits.
            
            Build structure projects which
            
            contains an information about capital and profit from each project,
            
            is sorted by capitals, and
            
            provides pop operation to remove already taken projects.
            
            That could be min heap in Java and array of sets in Python.
            
            Iterate over k to choose k projects. At each step
            
            Update a list of projects available with the current capital. One could choose max heap as a structure for available projects to simplify the peek of the most profitable one on the next step.
            
            If there are any, choose the most profitable one, update W and proceed further.
            
            Break, if the capital isn't large enough to start any project.
            
            Return W.

            Time complexity:
            
            \mathcal{O}(N \log k)O(Nlogk) in the best case when all projects are available with the initial capital.
            
            Otherwise, one needs \mathcal{O}(N \log N)O(NlogN) time to create and sort projects, and another \mathcal{O}(N \log N)O(NlogN) to update the available projects, and finally \mathcal{O}(k \log N)O(klogN) to compute the capital.
            
            Hence, the overall time complexity is \mathcal{O}(N \log N + N \log N + k \log N)O(NlogN+NlogN+klogN). Assuming that k < Nk<N, we would have \mathcal{O}(N \log N)O(NlogN) time complexity at the end.

        Approach 2: Greedy with Array

        In the previous approach, we applied the Heap data structure to track the available projects and the ones that are implemented. We could actually implement the Greedy algorithm without the need of Heap.
        
        The idea is to keep all projects in the list, and use the technique of in-place modification to mark the ones that have been selected.
        
        Here one could set the capital to start as infinity for the projects which are already done.

        Iterate over k to choose k projects. At each step
        
        Choose the most profitable project. For that, iterate over all N projects and between the ones with W >= Capital[j], choose the project with max Profits[j].
