leetcode 79. Word Search

# Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.
# The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell,
# where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring.
# The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# For example,
# Given board =
# [
#  ['A','B','C','E'],
#  ['S','F','C','S'],
#  ['A','D','E','E']
# ]

# word = "ABCCED", -> returns true,
# word = "SEE", -> returns true,
# word = "ABCB", -> returns false.

212. Word Search II

Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally 
or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.


Example 1:

Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
Example 2:

Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 12
board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.
