# 719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance

# <Multiplication Table>
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table

# Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out 
# the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

# Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, 
# you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

# Example 1:
# Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
# Output: 
# Explanation: 
# The Multiplication Table:
# 1	 2	3
# 2	 4	6
# 3	 6	9

# The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).

# Example 2:
# Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
# Output: 
# Explanation: 
# The Multiplication Table:
# 1	 2	3
# 2	 4	6

# The 6-th smallest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).

# Letâ€™s binary search for the answer A.

# Say enough(x) is true if and only if there are k or more values in the multiplication table that are less than or equal to x.
# Colloquially, enough describes whether x is large enough to be the k-th value in the multiplication table.

# Then (for our answer A), whenever x >= A, enough(x) is True; and whenever x < A, enough(x) is False.

# In our binary search, our loop invariant is that enough(hi) = True.
# More specifically, if we were to apply enough onto each argument in the interval [lo, hi], we would see 0 or more False, followed by 1 or more True.
# Once lo == hi, we know that enough(lo) = True, and it must have been the smallest such one, because lo must have been hi-1 or hi-2 at some point,
# and mi = hi-1 would have been checked.

# This leaves us with the task of counting how many values are less than or equal to x.
# For each of m rows, the i-th row looks like [i, 2*i, 3*i, ..., n*i], and there are min(x // i, n) values in that row that are less than or equal to x.
