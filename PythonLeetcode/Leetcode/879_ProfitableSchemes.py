879. Profitable Schemes

There is a group of G members, and a list of various crimes they could commit.

The ith crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it.

If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least P profit,
and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.

How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.



Example 1:

Input: G = 5, P = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
To make a profit of at least 3, the group could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
In total, there are 2 schemes.
Example 2:

Input: G = 10, P = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation:
To make a profit of at least 5, the group could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).


Note:

1 <= G <= 100
0 <= P <= 100
1 <= group[i] <= 100
0 <= profit[i] <= 100
1 <= group.length = profit.length <= 100

    Well, it is a Knapsack problem and my first intuition is dp.

    dp[i][j] means the count of schemes with i profit and j members.

    The dp equation is simple here:
    dp[i + p][j + g] += dp[i][j]) if i + p < P
    dp[P][j + g] += dp[i][j]) if i + p >= P

    Don't forget to take care of overflow.

    For each pair (p, g) of (profit, group), I update the count in dp.

    Approach 1: Dynamic Programming
    Intuition

    We don't care about the profit of the scheme if it is \geq Pâ‰¥P, because it surely will be over the threshold of profitability required. Similarly,
    we don't care about the number of people required in the scheme if it is > G>G, since we know the scheme will be too big for the gang to execute.

    As a result, the bounds are small enough to use dynamic programming. Let's keep track of cur[p][g],
    the number of schemes with profitability pp and requiring gg gang members: except we'll say (without changing the answer) that all schemes that profit at least P dollars will instead profit exactly P dollars.

    Algorithm

    Keeping track of cur[p][g] as defined above, let's understand how it changes as we consider 1 extra crime that will profit p0 and require g0 gang members. We will put the updated counts into cur2.

    For each possible scheme with profit p1 and group size g1, that scheme plus the extra crime (p0, g0) being considered, has a profit of p2 = min(p1 + p0, P), and uses a group size of g2 = g1 + g0.
