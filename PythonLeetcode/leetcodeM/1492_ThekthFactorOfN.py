1492. The kth Factor of n

Given two positive integers n and k.

A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.



Example 1:

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.
Example 4:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Factors list is [1], the 1st factor is 1.
Example 5:

Input: n = 1000, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000].


Constraints:

1 <= k <= n <= 1000

    Overview
    In this article, we consider three solutions.

    Algorithm

    Initialize max heap. Use PriorityQueue in Java and heap in Python. heap is a min-heap. Hence, to implement max heap, change the sign of divisor before pushing it into the heap.

    If xx is a divisor of NN, push xx and its pair divisor n / xn/x into the heap of size kk.

    Approach 3: Math, O(Nlog(k))
    Algorithm

    Initialize a list divisors to store the divisors.
    
    Iterate by xx from 11 to \sqrt{N} 

    If x is a divisor of NN, decrease kk by one. Return x if k == 0.
    We're here because the kth divisor is not yet found. Although divisors already contains all "independent" divisors. 
    All other divisors are "paired" ones, i.e, the kth divisor could be computed as N / divisors[len(divisors) - k].
    
    But before that, we need a small correction for the case when NN is a perfect square. In that case, the divisor list contains a duplicate because \sqrt{N} appears two times. 
    To skip it, we have to increase k by one.
    
    Return N / divisors[len(divisors) - k] if k <= len(divisors) and -1 otherwise.
