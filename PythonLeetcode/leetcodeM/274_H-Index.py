274. H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

        Summary
        This article is for intermediate readers. It introduces the following ideas: Comparison Sort and Counting Sort.

        Solution
        Approach #1 (Sorting) [Accepted]

        Intuition

        Think geometrically. Imagine plotting a histogram where the y-axis represents the number of citations for each paper. After sorting in descending order, h-index is the length of the largest square in the histogram.

        h-index

        Figure 1. hh-index from a plot of decreasing citations for papers

        Algorithm
        To find such a square length, we first sort the citations array in descending order. After sorting, if citations[i] > i, then papers 0 to i all have at least i+1 citations.
        Thus, to find h-index, we search for the largest ii (let's call it i' ) such that citations[i] > i and therefore the h-index is i' + 1
