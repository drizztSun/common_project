518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. 
You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
 

Note:

You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

        Approach 1: Dynamic Programming
                
        Template

        This is a classical dynamic programming problem.

        Here is a template one could use:

        Define the base cases for which the answer is obvious.

        Develop the strategy to compute more complex case from more simple one.

        Link the answer to base cases with this strategy.

        Example

        Let's pic up an example: amount = 11, available coins - 2 cent, 5 cent and 10 cent. Note, that coins are unlimited.

        fig

        Base Cases: No Coins or Amount = 0

        If the total amount of money is zero, there is only one combination: to take zero coins.

        Another base case is no coins: zero combinations for amount > 0 and one combination for amount == 0.

        fig

        2 Cent Coins

        Let's do one step further and consider the situation with one kind of available coins: 2 cent.

        fig

        It's quite evident that there could be 1 or 0 combinations here, 1 combination for even amount and 0 combinations for the odd one.

        The same answer could be received in a recursive way, by computing the number of combinations for all amounts of money, from 0 to 11.

        First, that's quite obvious that all amounts less than 2 are not impacted by the presence of 2 cent coins. Hence for amount = 0 and for amount = 1 one could reuse the results from the figure 2.

        Starting from amount = 2, one could use 2 cent coins in the combinations. Since the amounts are considered gradually from 2 to 11, at each given moment one could be sure to add not more than one coin to the previously known combinations.

        So let's pick up 2 cent coin, and use it to make up amount = 2. The number of combinations with this 2 cent coin is a number combinations for amount = 0, i.e. 1.

        fig

        Now let's pick up 2 cent coin, and use it to make up amount = 3. The number of combinations with this 2 cent coin is a number combinations for amount = 1, i.e. 0.

        fig

        That leads to DP formula for number of combinations to make up the amount = x: dp[x] = dp[x] + dp[x - coin], where coin = 2 cents is a value of coins we're currently adding.

        fig

        2 Cent Coins + 5 Cent Coins + 10 Cent Coins

        Now let's add 5 cent coins. The formula is the same, but do not forget to add dp[x], number of combinations with 2 cent coins.

        fig

        The story is the same for 10 cent coins.

        fig

        Now the strategy is here:

        Add coins one-by-one, starting from base case "no coins".

        For each added coin, compute recursively the number of combinations for each amount of money from 0 to amount.

        Algorithm

        Initiate number of combinations array with the base case "no coins": dp[0] = 1, and all the rest = 0.

        Loop over all coins:

        For each coin, loop over all amounts from 0 to amount:

        For each amount x, compute the number of combinations: dp[x] += dp[x - coin].
        Return dp[amount].

        Implementation

        Complexity Analysis

        Time complexity: O(NÃ—amount), where N is a length of coins array.

        Space complexity: O(amount) to keep dp array.
