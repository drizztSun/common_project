377. Combination Sum IV

Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7.
 

Follow up:
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
How does it change the problem?
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

    Approach 1: Top-Down Dynamic Programming
    Intuition

    Let us start with an example. Given the input array of nums = [1, 2, 3] and the target = 4, we are asked to come up with a set of combinations so that the sum of each combination is equal to the target value.

    Let us clarify a bit on the reference of combination here, which is more of a permutation, to be more precise, where the order of elements does matter. For instance, we could have two combinations such as [1, 3] and [3, 1], which are valid and different for this problem. While, for the problem of Coin Changes II, these two combinations would be considered to be the same.

    So to summarize a bit, the order of elements in the combination does matter for this problem.

    Approach 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming
    Intuition

    Another well-known form of dynamic programming algorithm is bottom-up, as opposed to top-down, where one often sees the application of one dimentional or multi-dimentional array (i.e. dp[]).

    As a reminder, here is the formula we derived before:
    Algorithm

    Based on the above intuition, here are some sample implementations.

    One can see the ressemblance between the top-down and bottom-up approaches. In certain perspective, the bottom-up approach is equivalent to the unfolding of the top-down approach with memoization.

    Complexity Analysis

    Let TT be the target value, and NN be the number of elements in the input array.

    Time Complexity: \mathcal{O}(T \cdot N)O(Tâ‹…N)

    We have a nested loop, with the number of iterations as TT and NN respectively.

    Hence, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is \mathcal{O}(T \cdot N)O(Tâ‹…N).

    Space Complexity: \mathcal{O}(T)O(T)

    We allocate an array dp[i] to hold all the intermediate values, which amounts to \mathcal{O}(T)O(T) space.
