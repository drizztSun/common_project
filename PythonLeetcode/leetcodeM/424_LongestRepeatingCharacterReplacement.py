# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

# Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times. 
# Find the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

# Note:
# Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.

# Example 1:

# Input:
# s = "ABAB", k = 2
# Output:
# 4

# Explanation:
# Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

# Example 2:

# Input:
# s = "AABABBA", k = 1
# Output:
# 4

# Explanation:
# Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
# The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

        Do we really need to know what substring get this result? Not, we only need to know the size.

        That will be the maximum number. so it means we don't need to substring details. 
        We just need to in index 'i', if i > maxfrequency + k, we need to remove a letter, if what we read is not majority, we needs to remove letter s[i-maxfrequency-k] because of k's operations.
