189. Rotate Array

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Follow up:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105

    Approach 2: Using Extra Array
    Algorithm

    We use an extra array in which we place every element of the array at its correct position i.e.
    the number at index ii in the original array is placed at the index (i + k) \% \text{ length of array}(i+k)% length of array.
    Then, we copy the new array to the original one.

    Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n). One pass is used to put the numbers in the new array. And another pass to copy the new array to the original one.
    Space complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n). Another array of the same size is used.

        n = len(nums)
        a = [0] * n

        nums[:] = a

    """
    Approach 4: Using Reverse
    Algorithm
    
    This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times, k%nk elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest of the elements from the front shift backwards.
    
    In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest n-knâˆ’k elements gives us the required result.
    
    Let n = 7n=7 and k = 3k=3.

    After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
    After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result
