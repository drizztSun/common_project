# 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence

# A sequence X_1, X_2, ..., X_n is fibonacci-like if:

# n >= 3
# X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2} for all i + 2 <= n
# Given a strictly increasing array A of positive integers forming a sequence, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of A.
# If one does not exist, return 0.

# (Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements (including none) from A,
# without changing the order of the remaining elements.  For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].)


# Example 1:

# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# Output: 5
# Explanation:
# The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].

# Example 2:

# Input: [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like:
# [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].

    Approach 2: Dynamic Programming
    Intuition

    Think of two consecutive terms A[i], A[j] in a fibonacci-like subsequence as a single node (i, j),
    and the entire subsequence is a path between these consecutive nodes.
    For example, with the fibonacci-like subsequence (A[1] = 2, A[2] = 3, A[4] = 5, A[7] = 8, A[10] = 13),
    we have the path between nodes (1, 2) <-> (2, 4) <-> (4, 7) <-> (7, 10).

    The motivation for this is that two nodes (i, j) and (j, k) are connected if and only if A[i] + A[j] == A[k],
    and we needed this amount of information to know about this connection. Now we have a problem similar to Longest Increasing Subsequence.

    Algorithm

    Let longest[i, j] be the longest path ending in [i, j]. Then longest[j, k] = longest[i, j] + 1 if (i, j) and (j, k) are connected.
    Since i is uniquely determined as A.index(A[k] - A[j]), this is efficient: we check for each j < k what i is potentially, and update longest[j, k] accordingly.

    Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(N^2), where NN is the length of A.

    Space Complexity: O(NlogM), where MM is the largest element of A.
    We can show that the number of elements in a subsequence is bounded by O( where aa is the minimum element in the subsequence.

        Approach 1: Brute Force with Set
        Intuition

        Every Fibonacci-like subsequence has each two adjacent terms determine the next expected term. For example, with 2, 5, we expect that the sequence must continue 7, 12, 19, 31, etc.

        We can use a Set structure to determine quickly whether the next term is in the array A or not. Because of the exponential growth of these terms, there are at most 43 terms in any Fibonacci-like subsequence that has maximum value \leq 10^9â‰¤10
        9
        .

        Algorithm

        For each starting pair A[i], A[j], we maintain the next expected value y = A[i] + A[j] and the previously seen largest value x = A[j]. If y is in the array, then we can then update these values (x, y) -> (y, x+y).

        Also, because subsequences are only fibonacci-like if they have length 3 or more, we must perform the check ans >= 3 ? ans : 0 at the end.
