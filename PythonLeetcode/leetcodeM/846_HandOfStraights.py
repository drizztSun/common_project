846. Hand of Straights

Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.

Return true if and only if she can.

Note: This question is the same as 1296: https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-in-sets-of-k-consecutive-numbers/

 

Example 1:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]
Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.

 

Constraints:

1 <= hand.length <= 10000
0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
1 <= W <= hand.length

        Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]
        Intuition

        We will repeatedly try to form a group (of size W) starting with the lowest card. This works because the lowest card still in our hand must be the bottom end of a size W straight.

        Algorithm

        Let's keep a count {card: number of copies of card} as a TreeMap (or dict).

        Then, repeatedly we will do the following steps: find the lowest value card that has 1 or more copies (say with value x), 
        and try to remove x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+W-1 from our count. If we can't, then the task is impossible.

        Complexity Analysis

        Time Complexity: O(Nâˆ—(N/W)), where N is the length of hand. The (N/W) factor comes from min(count). 
        In Java, the (N/W) factor becomes logN due to the complexity of TreeMap.

        Space Complexity: O(N).
