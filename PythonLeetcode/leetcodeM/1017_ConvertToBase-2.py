# 1017. Convert to Base -2

# Given a number N, return a string consisting of "0"s and "1"s that represents its value in base -2 (negative two).

# The returned string must have no leading zeroes, unless the string is "0".


# Example 1:

# Input: 2
# Output: "110"
# Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 = 2

# Example 2:

# Input: 3
# Output: "111"
# Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 + (-2) ^ 0 = 3

# Example 3:

# Input: 4
# Output: "100"
# Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 = 4


# Note:

# 0 <= N <= 10^9

        Intuition
        Maybe write a base2 function first?
        How about add minus -?
        Done.

        Explanation
        base2 function is quite basis of basis.

        check last digit by N%2 or N&1.
        If it's 1, you get 1.
        If it's 0, you get 0.

        shift to right N >> 1.
        This actually do two things:
        2.1 Minus 1 if last digit is 1.
        2.2 Divide N by 2.

        base -2 is no difference,
        except that we need divide N by -2.

        So we do the same thing,
        just add a sign - after division.

        The explanation seems not enough.
        But if you really understand how we do the base2,
        you will find just literally the same process.


        More about N = -(N >> 1)
        Explained by @yren2:
        It's mostly implementation defined. and most compilers choose to preserve the sign by setting the most significant bits after the shift.
        for example, -3 in 8-bit is 11111101 and -3>>1 is 11111110, which is -2. (round towards -inf)

        this is different from -3/2, which is -1. (round towards 0)
        same goes -3>>2 == -1 and -3/4 == 0.


        Complexity
        Time O(logN)
        Space O(logN)

        Note that I didn't deal with string concatenation,
        and just take this part as O(1).

        Instead of create a new string each time,
        we can improve this process using some operations join/reverse or data structure list/vector .
        Like Java we may need StringBuilder,
        but those are not what I want to discuss deeply here.

        Explanation
        Inspired by @wen_han, I'd like to share this solution.
        First we find a big number x with its binary value 10101...10101
        x needs to be bigger than 10^9 so it can cover all input N.

        Here I choose mask = 2^32 / 3 = 1431655765 and we have mask > 10^9

        The 01 pattern binary number have 2 special characters:

        Because it has 0 on all even bits, which are negative bits in base -2,
        it has same value in base 2 and base -2.
        When we bitwise operation mask ^ x, we will change some 1 to 0 on odd position, and change some 0to 1 on even position.
        
        In the view of base -2, we actually mask - x.
        So mask ^ x in base 2 is same as mask - x in base -2.

        Take advantage of this observation:
        mask ^ (mask - x) in base 2 is same as mask - (mask - x) = x in base -2.
        So we get the result of this problem.


        Example
        N = 3 has reault 00111 in base -2.

        N = 3 = 00011
        mask = 21 = 10101
        mask - N = 18 = 10010
        mask ^ (mask - N) = 00111


        Complexity
        1431655765 ^ (1431655765 - N) is O(1)
        Transform of binary string,
        I'll say O(1) for small integer,
        O(logN) for big number.
