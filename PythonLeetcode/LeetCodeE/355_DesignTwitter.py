# 355. Design Twitter

# Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, 
# follow/unfollow another user and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed. 
# Your design should support the following methods:

# postTweet(userId, tweetId): Compose a new tweet.

# getNewsFeed(userId): Retrieve the 10 most recent tweet ids in the user's news feed.
# Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user herself. 
# Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.

# follow(followerId, followeeId): Follower follows a followee.

# unfollow(followerId, followeeId): Follower unfollows a followee.
