# 846. Hand of Straights

# Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.

# Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.

# Return true if and only if she can.


# Example 1:

# Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
# Output: true
# Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
# Example 2:

# Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
# Output: false
# Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.


# Note:

# 1 <= hand.length <= 10000
# 0 <= hand[i] <= 10^9
# 1 <= W <= hand.length

    Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]
    Intuition

    We will repeatedly try to form a group (of size W) starting with the lowest card. This works because the lowest card still in our hand must be the bottom end of a size W straight.

    Algorithm

    Let's keep a count {card: number of copies of card} as a TreeMap (or dict).

    Then, repeatedly we will do the following steps: find the lowest value card that has 1 or more copies (say with value x), and try to remove x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+W-1 from our count.
    If we can't, then the task is impossible.

    Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: O(Nâˆ—(N/W)), where NN is the length of hand. The (N/W) factor comes from min(count).
    In Java, the (N/W) factor becomes \log NlogN due to the complexity of TreeMap.

    Space Complexity: O(N).
