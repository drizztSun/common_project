# 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

# Given a non-empty integer array of size n, 
# find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal,
# where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

# Example:

# Input:
# [1,2,3]

# Output:
# 3

# Explanation:
# Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

# [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

class minMoves(object):
    def doit(self, nums):

        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        # Adding 1 to n - 1 elements is the same as subtracting 1 from one element,
        # w.r.t goal of making the elements in the array equal.
        # So, best way to do this is make all the elements in the array equal to the min element.
        # sum(array) - n * minimum

        # First, the method of decreasing 1 instead of adding 1 for n-1 elements is brilliant.
        # But, when I was doing the contest, I was dumb, so dumb to think outside the box. And this is how I tackled it using just math logic.

        # First, traverse the array, get the sum and the minimum value.
        # If every element is equal, then min*(len) should equal to sum.
        # This part is easy to understand. So, if they are not equal, what should we do? we should keep adding 1 to the array for k times until min*(len)==sum. Then we have:

        # len*(min+k)=sum+k*(len-1).
        # ==> k=sum-min*len;

        # Looks familiar? If you do it by decreasing 1 each time, this equation should be easy to understand!
        # Some of you may have this question: how can I be sure that after adding 1 to (n-1) elements in the array,
        # the minimum value is the previous min plus one. Is it possible that the minimum value stays the same after this? The answer is no, 
        # it's not possible. As long as all elements are not same, adding 1 to (n-1) elements meaning only one element in the array is not getting a candy. 
        # And Iï¿½m sure you will choose not to give the candy to the oldest one. So, yes, every time you do that add operation, the min value adds 1.
