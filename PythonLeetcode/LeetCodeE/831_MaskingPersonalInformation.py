# 831. Masking Personal Information

# We are given a personal information string S, which may represent either an email address or a phone number.

# We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:


# 1. Email address:

# We define a name to be a string of length â‰¥ 2 consisting of only lowercase letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z.

# An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name.

# All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of "name1@name2.name3".

# To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.


# 2. Phone number:

# A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}.
# You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.

# The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional.
# We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.

# The local number should be formatted and masked as "***-***-1111", where 1 represents the exposed digits.

# To mask a phone number with country code like "+111 111 111 1111", we write it in the form "+***-***-***-1111".

# The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.
# For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with "+**-".

# Note that extraneous characters like "(", ")", " ", as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.
# Return the correct "mask" of the information provided.


# Example 1:

# Input: "LeetCode@LeetCode.com"
# Output: "l*****e@leetcode.com"
# Explanation: All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between the
#              first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 asterisks.
#              Therefore, "leetcode" -> "l*****e".

# Example 2:

# Input: "AB@qq.com"
# Output: "a*****b@qq.com"
# Explanation: There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter
#              of the first name "ab". Therefore, "ab" -> "a*****b".

# Example 3:

# Input: "1(234)567-890"
# Output: "***-***-7890"
# Explanation: 10 digits in the phone number, which means all digits make up the local number.

# Example 4:

# Input: "86-(10)12345678"
# Output: "+**-***-***-5678"
# Explanation: 12 digits, 2 digits for country code and 10 digits for local number.
# Notes:

# S.length <= 40.
# Emails have length at least 8.
# Phone numbers have length at least 10.

Approach #1: Direct [Accepted]
Intuition and Algorithm

We perform the algorithm as described.

First, to check if information is an email, we check whether it contains a '@'.
(There are many different tests: we could check for letters versus digits, for example.)

If we have an email, we should replace the first name with the first letter of that name, followed by 5 asterisks, followed by the last letter of that name.

If we have a phone number, we should collect all the digits and then format it according to the description.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(1), if we consider the length of S as bounded by a constant.

Space Complexity: O(1).
