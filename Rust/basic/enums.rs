    The syntax if let takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign.
    It works the same way as a match, where the expression is given to the match and the pattern is its first arm.

    Using if let means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
    However, you lose the exhaustive checking that match enforces.
    Choosing between match and if let depends on what youâ€™re doing in your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.

    In other words, you can think of if let as syntax sugar for a match that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.
