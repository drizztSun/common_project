// *** Derive ***
// The compiler is capable of providing basic implementations for some traits via the #[derive] attribute.
// These traits can still be manually implemented if a more complex behavior is required.

// The following is a list of derivable traits:

// Comparison traits: Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd.
// Clone, to create T from &T via a copy.
// Copy, to give a type 'copy semantics' instead of 'move semantics'.
/// Hash, to compute a hash from &T.
// Default, to create an empty instance of a data type.
// Debug, to format a value using the {:?} formatter.
use std::cmp::{PartialEq, PartialOrd};
use std::ops;

use std::iter;
use std::vec::IntoIter;

// `Centimeters`, a tuple struct that can be compared
#[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Centimeters(f64);

// `Inches`, a tuple struct that can be printed
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Inches(i32);

impl Inches {
    fn to_centimeters(&self) -> Centimeters {
        let &Inches(inches) = self;

        Centimeters(inches as f64 * 2.54)
    }
}

// `Seconds`, a tuple struct with no additional attributes
struct Seconds(i32);

fn test_derive_basic() {
    let _one_second = Seconds(1);

    // Error: `Seconds` can't be printed; it doesn't implement the `Debug` trait
    //println!("One second looks like: {:?}", _one_second);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // Error: `Seconds` can't be compared; it doesn't implement the `PartialEq` trait
    //let _this_is_true = (_one_second == _one_second);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    let foot = Inches(12);

    println!("One foot equals {:?}", foot);

    let meter = Centimeters(100.0);

    let cmp = if foot.to_centimeters() < meter {
        "smaller"
    } else {
        "bigger"
    };

    println!("One foot is {} than one meter.", cmp);
}

// *** Returning Traits with dyn ***
// The Rust compiler needs to know how much space every function's return type requires.
// This means all your functions have to return a concrete type. Unlike other languages, if you have a trait like Animal, you can't write a function that returns Animal,
// because its different implementations will need different amounts of memory.

// However, there's an easy workaround. Instead of returning a trait object directly, our functions return a Box which contains some Animal.
// A box is just a reference to some memory in the heap. Because a reference has a statically-known size, and the compiler can guarantee it points to a heap-allocated Animal,
// we can return a trait from our function!

// Rust tries to be as explicit as possible whenever it allocates memory on the heap.
// So if your function returns a pointer-to-trait-on-heap in this way, you need to write the return type with the dyn keyword, e.g. Box<dyn Animal>.

struct Sheep {}
struct Cow {}

trait Animal {
    // Instance method signature
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str;
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Sheep`.
impl Animal for Sheep {
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        "baaaaah!"
    }
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Cow`.
impl Animal for Cow {
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        "moooooo!"
    }
}

// Returns some struct that implements Animal, but we don't know which one at compile time.
fn random_animal(random_number: f64) -> Box<dyn Animal> {
    if random_number < 0.5 {
        Box::new(Sheep {})
    } else {
        Box::new(Cow {})
    }
}

fn test_dyn_basic() {
    let random_number = 0.234;
    let animal = random_animal(random_number);
    println!(
        "You've randomly chosen an animal, and it says {}",
        animal.noise()
    );
}

// *** Operator Overloading ***
// In Rust, many of the operators can be overloaded via traits. That is, some operators can be used to accomplish different tasks based on their input arguments.
// This is possible because operators are syntactic sugar for method calls. For example, the + operator in a + b calls the add method (as in a.add(b)).
// This add method is part of the Add trait. Hence, the + operator can be used by any implementor of the Add trait.

// A list of the traits, such as Add, that overload operators can be found in core::ops.
struct Foo;
struct Bar;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct FooBar;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct BarFoo;

// The `std::ops::Add` trait is used to specify the functionality of `+`.
// Here, we make `Add<Bar>` - the trait for addition with a RHS of type `Bar`.
// The following block implements the operation: Foo + Bar = FooBar
impl ops::Add<Bar> for Foo {
    type Output = FooBar;

    fn add(self, _rhs: Bar) -> FooBar {
        println!("> Foo.add(Bar) was called");

        FooBar
    }
}

// By reversing the types, we end up implementing non-commutative addition.
// Here, we make `Add<Foo>` - the trait for addition with a RHS of type `Foo`.
// This block implements the operation: Bar + Foo = BarFoo
impl ops::Add<Foo> for Bar {
    type Output = BarFoo;

    fn add(self, _rhs: Foo) -> BarFoo {
        println!("> Bar.add(Foo) was called");

        BarFoo
    }
}

fn test_operator_overloading() {
    println!("Foo + Bar = {:?}", Foo + Bar);
    println!("Bar + Foo = {:?}", Bar + Foo);
}

// *** Drop ***
// The Drop trait only has one method: drop, which is called automatically when an object goes out of scope. The main use of the Drop trait is to free the resources that the implementor instance owns.

// Box, Vec, String, File, and Process are some examples of types that implement the Drop trait to free resources. The Drop trait can also be manually implemented for any custom data type.

// The following example adds a print to console to the drop function to announce when it is called.

struct Droppable {
    name: &'static str,
}

impl Drop for Droppable {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("> Dropping {}", self.name);
    }
}

fn test_drop_basic() {
    let _a = Droppable { name: "a" };

    // block A
    {
        let _b = Droppable { name: "b" };

        // block B
        {
            let _c = Droppable { name: "c" };
            let _d = Droppable { name: "d" };

            println!("Exiting block B");
        }
        println!("Just exited block B");

        println!("Exiting block A");
    }
    println!("Just exited block A");

    // Variable can be manually dropped using the `drop` function
    drop(_a);
    // TODO ^ Try commenting this line

    println!("end of the main function");

    // `_a` *won't* be `drop`ed again here, because it already has been
    // (manually) `drop`ed
}

// *** Iterators ***
// The Iterator trait is used to implement iterators over collections such as arrays.

// The trait requires only a method to be defined for the next element, which may be manually defined in an impl block or automatically defined (as in arrays and ranges).

// As a point of convenience for common situations, the for construct turns some collections into iterators using the .into_iter() method.

struct Fabonacci {
    curr: u32,
    next: u32,
}

// Implement `Iterator` for `Fibonacci`.
// The `Iterator` trait only requires a method to be defined for the `next` element.
impl Iterator for Fabonacci {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<u32> {
        let new_next = self.curr + self.next;

        self.curr = self.next;
        self.next = new_next;

        // Since there's no endpoint to a Fibonacci sequence, the `Iterator`
        // will never return `None`, and `Some` is always returned.
        Some(self.curr)
    }
}

// Returns a Fibonacci sequence generator
impl Fabonacci {
    fn new() -> Fabonacci {
        Fabonacci { curr: 0, next: 1 }
    }
}

fn test_iterator_basic() {
    // `0..3` is an `Iterator` that generates: 0, 1, and 2.
    let mut sequence = 0..3;

    println!("Four consecutive `next` calls on 0..3");
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());
    println!("> {:?}", sequence.next());

    // `for` works through an `Iterator` until it returns `None`.
    // Each `Some` value is unwrapped and bound to a variable (here, `i`).
    println!("Iterate through 0..3 using `for`");
    for i in 0..3 {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

    // The `take(n)` method reduces an `Iterator` to its first `n` terms.
    println!("The first four terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: ");
    for i in Fabonacci::new().take(4) {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

    // The `skip(n)` method shortens an `Iterator` by dropping its first `n` terms.
    println!("The next four terms of the Fibonacci sequence are: ");
    for i in Fabonacci::new().skip(4).take(4) {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }

    let array = [1u32, 3, 3, 7];

    // The `iter` method produces an `Iterator` over an array/slice.
    println!("Iterate the following array {:?}", &array);
    for i in array.iter() {
        println!("> {}", i);
    }
}

// impl Trait
// If your function returns a type that implements MyTrait, you can write its return type as -> impl MyTrait. This can help simplify your type signatures quite a lot!

// This function combines two `Vec<i32>` and returns an iterator over it.
// Look how complicated its return type is!
fn combine_vecs_explicit_return_type(
    v: Vec<i32>,
    u: Vec<i32>,
) -> iter::Cycle<iter::Chain<IntoIter<i32>, IntoIter<i32>>> {
    v.into_iter().chain(u.into_iter()).cycle()
}

// This is the exact same function, but its return type uses `impl Trait`.
// Look how much simpler it is!
fn combine_vecs(v: Vec<i32>, u: Vec<i32>) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
    v.into_iter().chain(u.into_iter()).cycle()
}

fn test_impl_trait() {
    let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let v2 = vec![4, 5];
    let mut v3 = combine_vecs(v1, v2);
    assert_eq!(Some(1), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(2), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(3), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(4), v3.next());
    assert_eq!(Some(5), v3.next());
    println!("all done");

    let plus_one = make_adder_function(1);
    assert_eq!(plus_one(2), 3);
}

// More importantly, some Rust types can't be written out. For example, every closure has its own unnamed concrete type.
// Before impl Trait syntax, you had to allocate on the heap in order to return a closure. But now you can do it all statically, like this:
// Returns a function that adds `y` to its input
fn make_adder_function(y: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    let closure = move |x: i32| x + y;
    closure
}

// You can also use impl Trait to return an iterator that uses map or filter closures! This makes using map and filter easier.
// Because closure types don't have names, you can't write out an explicit return type if your function returns iterators with closures. But with impl Trait you can do this easily:
fn double_positives<'a>(numbers: &'a Vec<i32>) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> + 'a {
    numbers.iter().filter(|x| x > &&0).map(|x| x * 2)
}

// *** Clone ***
// When dealing with resources, the default behavior is to transfer them during assignments or function calls.
// However, sometimes we need to make a copy of the resource as well.
// The Clone trait helps us do exactly this. Most commonly, we can use the .clone() method defined by the Clone trait.

// A unit struct without resources
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Nil;

// A tuple struct with resources that implements the `Clone` trait
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct Pair(Box<i32>, Box<i32>);

fn test_clone_basic() {
    // Instantiate `Nil`
    let nil = Nil;
    // Copy `Nil`, there are no resources to move
    let copied_nil = nil;

    // Both `Nil`s can be used independently
    println!("original: {:?}", nil);
    println!("copy: {:?}", copied_nil);

    // Instantiate `Pair`
    let pair = Pair(Box::new(1), Box::new(2));
    println!("original: {:?}", pair);

    // Copy `pair` into `moved_pair`, moves resources
    let moved_pair = pair;
    println!("copy: {:?}", moved_pair);

    // Error! `pair` has lost its resources
    //println!("original: {:?}", pair);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
    // Clone `moved_pair` into `cloned_pair` (resources are included)
    let cloned_pair = moved_pair.clone();
    // Drop the original pair using std::mem::drop
    drop(moved_pair);

    // Error! `moved_pair` has been dropped
    //println!("copy: {:?}", moved_pair);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // The result from .clone() can still be used!
    println!("clone: {:?}", cloned_pair);
}

// *** Supertraits ***
// Rust doesn't have "inheritance", but you can define a trait as being a superset of another trait. For example:
trait Person {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
}

// Student is a supertrait of Person.
// Implementing Student requires you to also impl Person.
trait Student: Person {
    fn university(&self) -> String;
}

trait Programmer {
    fn fav_language(&self) -> String;
}

// CompSciStudent (computer science student) is a supertrait of both Programmer
// and Student. Implementing CompSciStudent requires you to impl both subtraits.
trait CompSciStudent: Programmer + Student {
    fn git_username(&self) -> String;
}

fn comp_sci_student_greeting(student: &dyn CompSciStudent) -> String {
    format!(
        "My name is {} and I attend {}. My Git username is {}",
        student.name(),
        student.university(),
        student.git_username()
    )
}

// *** Disambiguating overlapping traits ***
// A type can implement many different traits. What if two traits both require the same name? For example, many traits might have a method named get().
// They might even have different return types!

// Good news: because each trait implementation gets its own impl block, it's clear which trait's get method you're implementing.
// What about when it comes time to call those methods? To disambiguate between them, we have to use Fully Qualified Syntax.
trait UsernameWidget {
    // Get the selected username out of this widget
    fn get(&self) -> String;
}

trait AgeWidget {
    // Get the selected age out of this widget
    fn get(&self) -> u8;
}

// A form with both a UsernameWidget and an AgeWidget
struct Form {
    username: String,
    age: u8,
}

impl UsernameWidget for Form {
    fn get(&self) -> String {
        self.username.clone()
    }
}

impl AgeWidget for Form {
    fn get(&self) -> u8 {
        self.age
    }
}

fn test_disambiguating_overlapping_traits() {
    let form = Form {
        username: "rustacean".to_owned(),
        age: 28,
    };

    // If you uncomment this line, you'll get an error saying
    // "multiple `get` found". Because, after all, there are multiple methods
    // named `get`.
    // println!("{}", form.get());

    let username = <Form as UsernameWidget>::get(&form);
