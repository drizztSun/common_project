    So what types are Copy? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule,
    any group of simple scalar values can be Copy, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource is Copy.
    Here are some of the types that are Copy:

    All the integer types, such as u32.
    The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    All the floating point types, such as f64.
    The character type, char.
    Tuples, if they only contain types that are also Copy. For example, (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not.
